## Advancements in Automated Skin Cancer Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Review and Analysis

The integration of ML system, aimed at providing assistance in skin cancer diagnosis.

## About
Skin cancer, ranking as the sixth most prevalent cancer globally, poses a significant public health concern due to its increasing incidence and potential morbidity. This paper presents an exhaustive examination of the latest advancements in automated skin cancer diagnosis, focusing on detection and classification methodologies. After outlining the epidemiology and etiology of skin cancer, including its association with UV radiation exposure and immune system dysfunction, the paper elaborates on the critical role of early detection in improving patient outcomes. By exploring the diverse types of skin cancer, including Melanoma, Basal cell carcinoma, and Squamous cell carcinoma, the paper underscores the urgent need for accurate and efficient diagnostic tools to 
address the varying degrees of malignancy and treatment complexities associated with each subtype.
